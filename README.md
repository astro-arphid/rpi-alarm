With gravitational waves expected to be arriving thick and fast in the upcoming O3 run of Advanced LIGO, we need to be alert! GW Astronomers and their professional EM counterparts have access to real-time data on the status of the instruments and the latest candidate events, but we would like to share the news with students and staff in the dept by creating a gravitational-wave alarm. This project aims to develop a low-cost device which interface with LIGO's realtime systems and display detector and trigger information on simple hardware. It will involve a blend of programming and electronics based on a raspberry pi to process data and control displays. Advanced functionality may include a voice or touch-screen interface. Once prototyped, the design can be documented and used in outreach programmes at Glasgow and other LSC institutions.
